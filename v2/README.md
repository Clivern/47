dotfiles are a very personal thing. They are shaped through years of experience, defeat, education, guidance taken, and ingenuity rewarded. Being without your personal configurations, you feel like a lost and helpless outsider in an unknown and hostile environment. You are uncomfortable and disoriented, yearning to return to a place of familiarity - a place you constructed through your own adventures, where all the shortcuts are well-traveled, and which you proudly call `$HOME`.


### Usage

1. Clone the repository wherever you want. I like to keep it in `~/dotfiles`.

2. Install [flook](https://github.com/norwik/flook/) globally.

```zsh
$ pip install flook
```

3. Init the configs

```zsh
$ flook config init
```

4. Add local as a host.

```zsh
$ flook host add localhost -i localhost -c local
```

5. Add dotfiles recipes.
