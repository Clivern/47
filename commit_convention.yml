# not present: commit_types: using the default angular-style commit types
# they would look like this though:
# commit_types:
#  - type: description of what the short-form "type" means
scopes:
  # Array<{[key: string]: string}> defines both the order of scopes (nice for
  # keeping the most frequently used scopes/types on top, and requires
  # explanation of each commit_type/scope.
