`Dotfiles` are a very personal thing. They are shaped through years of experience, defeat, education, guidance taken, and ingenuity rewarded. Being without your personal configurations, you feel like a lost and helpless outsider in an unknown and hostile environment. You are uncomfortable and disoriented, yearning to return to a place of familiarity - a place you constructed through your own adventures, where all the shortcuts are well-traveled, and which you proudly call `$HOME`.


### Usage

1. Clone the repository.

```zsh
$ git clone git@github.com:Clivern/dotfiles.git

$ pip install ansible
$ pip install opswork
```

3. Init the configs

```zsh
$ opswork config init
$ opswork config dump
```

4. Add local as a host.

```zsh
$ make hosts
```

5. Add dotfiles recipes.

```zsh

```

6. Run recipes one by one or the needed ones. for example to run `clivern/ping` towards host with name `localhost`.
